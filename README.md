# RimFantasy - Arcane Weapons

This mod adds a number of magical defences designed to provide security to an area where manpower is insufficient. Expensive to craft but makes it up by being exceptionally powerful.

The gemstone pylons hold large amount of magical energy and will explode upon imminent destruction.

### Features

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but they can also be purchased from traders or obtained from salvaging certain objects.

Balance feedbacks are welcomed, please provide context when doing so.

- Save Game Compatible
- Will not play nice with other gemstone mods without a patch.
